# Welcome to MDX

This is a **Markdown** paragraph with _italic_ and **bold** text.

<Another />

## A list

- Apples  
- Bananas  
- Oranges

You can also include inline JSX elements, like this:

<div style={{ padding: "10px", backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0", borderRadius: "8px" }}>
  <p>This is a simple JSX block inside MDX.</p>
</div>

And a React-style component inline (no import needed for built-ins):

<button onClick={() => alert("Hello from MDX!")}>
  Click Me
</button>

> MDX lets you write Markdown and JSX together easily.
